            podr√≠amos hacer:
            for player in range(player_num):
                card = self.deck.pop()

How to create the deck:
    deck = []       
        for suit in suits:
            for number in numbers:
                self.deck.append(number+suit)
    self.deck = deck

Also:
        self.deck = []       
        for suit in suits:
            for number in numbers:
                self.deck.append(number+suit)


How to shuffle the deck can also be done either way:
-Importing (as it is done right now).
-Writing the code:
    def shuffle(self):
        for ix in range(len(self.desk)):
            new_position = random.randrange(len(self.desk))
            #Swapping items (cards) with empty glass technique.
            aux = list[new_position]
            list[new_position] = list[ix]
            list[ix] = aux
